# Cats-Dogs ExplainableClassifier
This project implements an image classifier for cats and dogs using EfficientNet-B0 in PyTorch. The focus is on model explainability, exploring techniques such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Integrated Gradients, and occlusion sensitivity to visualize which parts of the images contribute most to the classifierâ€™s predictions.
